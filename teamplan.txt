First thing key generation, probably public/private, management system to store it, key rotation/rovaction potentially? then bootloader with secure boot and decent protocols for firmware updates, make sure to use signing with the private key for firmware, probably TLS for the firmware updates
then you need something to verify firmware
can use the public key for that and use hashing to check the integrity of it
E2EE for the firmware downloading so MITM is covered
4.2 for example
